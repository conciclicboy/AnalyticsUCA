Data Analytics Course Session (Case):

Sessions 6-7 of INSEAD Big Data Analytics for Business Course: Classification

Each data file should be a .csv file with one worksheet which has as many rows as observations (e.g. people in a market research survey), and as many columns as attributes (e.g. people's demographics, attitudes to a product, etc). The .csv is  ";" separated (NOT other symbols, e.g. not ",") and decimals are with ","

File Boats has data from 2813 people each of which answered 82 survey questions. The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 2813 x 82.

File Boats_cluster.csv has one row per person (for the same 2813 people again) and 2 columns, the second one indicating the segment a person belongs to according to some segmentation.
