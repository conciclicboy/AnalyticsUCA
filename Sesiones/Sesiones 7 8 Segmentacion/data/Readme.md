Data Analytics Course Session:

Sessions 4-5 of INSEAD Data Analytics for Business Course: Clustering and Segmentation
---------------------------------------------------------

Each data file should be a .csv file with one worksheet which has as many rows as observations (e.g. people in a market research survey), and as many columns as attributes (e.g. people's demographics, attitudes to a product, etc). The .csv is  ";" separated (NOT other symbols, e.g. not ",") and decimals are with ","


File "Mall Visits.csv" has data from 40  customers of a shopping mall, for each of which we have 8 attributes: "V1", "V2", "V3", "V4", "V5", "V6" "Income", "Mall.Visits". The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 40 x 8. See the reading of Sessions 4-5 of the course for more information.

File "Boats.csv" has data from 2813 people each of which answered 79 survey questions. The size of the ProjectData matrix is therefore 2813 x 79.
